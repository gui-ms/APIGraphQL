# APIGraphQL
Simple project developed in nodejs, with the purpose of practicing the implementation of GraphQL APIs.

# How to use:
For this project we used the Thunder Client extension for the VSCode, so you gotta use it if you want to see it working.
- Run ´npm run dev´
- Open Thunder Client, go to localhost:3000/graphql and change it to POST;
- Run queries or mutations according to screenshots;
